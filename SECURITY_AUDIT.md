# Security Audit Report - Trackify Application

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on the Trackify subscription tracking application. The audit identified several security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Critical security headers have been implemented, and recommendations for additional security measures are provided.

## üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities (Fixed)

### 1. Missing Security Headers ‚úÖ FIXED
**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Status:** Resolved

**Issue:** The application lacked essential security headers, making it vulnerable to:
- Clickjacking attacks (X-Frame-Options)
- MIME type sniffing attacks (X-Content-Type-Options)
- XSS attacks (Content-Security-Policy)
- Information disclosure (Referrer-Policy)

**Fix Applied:** Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.ts`:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy` with strict directives

### 2. Environment Variable Validation ‚úÖ FIXED
**Risk Level:** High  
**Status:** Resolved

**Issue:** No validation of required environment variables, potentially causing runtime errors and security issues.

**Fix Applied:** Added environment variable validation in NextAuth configuration:
- Validates `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- Throws descriptive errors if variables are missing
- Removed unsafe `!` assertions

### 3. Insecure Error Handling ‚úÖ FIXED
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved

**Issue:** Detailed error messages were exposed to users, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Fix Applied:** Implemented error sanitization:
- Production error messages are generic
- Development error messages include details
- Removed sensitive information from error responses

## üü° Medium Priority Issues (Partially Addressed)

### 4. Input Validation Improvements ‚úÖ ENHANCED
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Status:** Improved

**Enhancements Applied:**
- Added length limits to string inputs (name: 100 chars, category: 50 chars)
- Added numeric validation for amounts (max: 999,999)
- Added date format validation
- Implemented query parameter sanitization
- Added enum validation for billing cycles and frequencies

### 5. Authentication & Session Security ‚úÖ ENHANCED
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Status:** Improved

**Enhancements Applied:**
- Added explicit session and JWT expiration times (30 days)
- Added session update age (24 hours)
- Improved JWT callback handling
- Added proper error pages configuration

### 6. Client-Side Security ‚úÖ IMPROVED
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Status:** Improved

**Enhancements Applied:**
- Replaced `alert()` calls with proper error handling
- Removed `window.location.reload()` usage
- Implemented proper state management for updates

## üü¢ Low Priority Issues (Identified)

### 7. Database Security
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Status:** Identified

**Recommendations:**
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add database connection encryption
- Consider using Prisma Accelerate for better security
- Implement database query logging for security monitoring

### 8. Rate Limiting
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Status:** Identified

**Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### 9. Logging & Monitoring
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Status:** Identified

**Recommendations:**
- Implement structured logging
- Add security event monitoring
- Remove console.log statements from production
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## üîß Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
The CSP has been implemented but should be reviewed and tightened based on actual application needs.

### 2. HTTPS Enforcement
Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production with proper certificate management.

### 3. Database Security
- Use connection pooling
- Implement row-level security if needed
- Regular security updates for database software

### 4. API Security
- Implement API versioning
- Add request/response validation middleware
- Consider implementing API keys for external access

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up security monitoring
- Implement intrusion detection
- Add alerting for suspicious activities
